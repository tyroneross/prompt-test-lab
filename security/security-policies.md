# Security Policies - Prompt Testing Lab

## Overview

This document outlines the security policies and best practices for the Prompt Testing Lab application.

## Security Framework

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### Authentication Methods
- **GitHub OAuth**: Primary authentication method
- **Magic Link**: Email-based authentication via Resend
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT tokens with rotation

#### Authorization Model
```
User Roles:
├── Guest (read-only access to public projects)
├── User (create/edit own projects and prompts)
├── Admin (full system access)
└── Service (API access for integrations)
```

#### Security Controls
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) recommended
- Session timeout: 24 hours
- Password requirements: 12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts, 15-minute lockout

### 2. Data Protection

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: Documentation, public project templates
- **Internal**: User profiles, project metadata
- **Confidential**: API keys, prompts, test results
- **Restricted**: Authentication tokens, passwords

#### Encryption Standards
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **Keys**: Stored in secure key management system (AWS KMS/Supabase Vault)

#### Data Retention
```
Data Type               | Retention Period | Backup Retention
------------------------|------------------|------------------
User accounts          | Until deletion   | 30 days
Project data           | Until deletion   | 30 days
Audit logs            | 1 year           | 90 days
Performance metrics   | 6 months         | 30 days
Error logs            | 3 months         | 30 days
```

### 3. Infrastructure Security

#### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
- **CDN**: CloudFront for DDoS protection and performance
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall for attack prevention

#### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 req/15min general, 10 req/min for LLM APIs
- **CORS**: Restricted to allowed origins only
- **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries only

#### Container Security
- **Base Images**: Official, minimal Alpine Linux images
- **Non-root**: Containers run as non-privileged user
- **Secrets**: Mounted as read-only volumes
- **Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans with Trivy

### 4. Third-Party Integrations

#### LLM Providers
- **API Keys**: Stored in environment variables, rotated monthly
- **Request Logging**: Minimal logging, no prompt content stored
- **Rate Limiting**: Provider-specific limits enforced
- **Fallback**: Multiple providers for redundancy

#### External Services
```
Service        | Purpose           | Data Shared
---------------|-------------------|------------------
GitHub         | Authentication    | Profile, email
Vercel         | Hosting          | Application code
Supabase       | Database         | All application data
Logflare       | Logging          | Application logs
Sentry         | Error tracking   | Error reports
```

### 5. Incident Response

#### Security Incident Classification
- **P1 (Critical)**: Data breach, system compromise
- **P2 (High)**: Service disruption, vulnerability exploit
- **P3 (Medium)**: Security policy violation
- **P4 (Low)**: Suspicious activity, policy deviation

#### Response Timeline
- **P1**: 15 minutes notification, 1 hour response
- **P2**: 1 hour notification, 4 hour response
- **P3**: 4 hours notification, 24 hour response
- **P4**: 24 hours notification, 72 hour response

#### Response Team
- **Incident Commander**: DevOps Lead
- **Security Officer**: Security Specialist
- **Technical Lead**: Senior Developer
- **Communications**: Product Manager

### 6. Access Controls

#### Administrative Access
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum required access
- **Time-limited**: Administrative sessions expire after 4 hours
- **Approval Required**: All privilege escalation requires approval
- **Audit Trail**: All administrative actions logged

#### Development Access
- **Separate Environments**: Dev/staging/prod isolation
- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires status checks
- **Secrets Management**: No secrets in code repositories

### 7. Monitoring & Alerting

#### Security Monitoring
- **Failed Authentication**: Alert after 5 failed attempts
- **Unusual Activity**: Geographic anomalies, off-hours access
- **API Abuse**: Rate limit violations, unusual patterns
- **Data Access**: Large data exports, bulk operations

#### Alert Channels
- **Critical**: PagerDuty, SMS, Email
- **High**: Slack, Email
- **Medium**: Email, Dashboard
- **Low**: Dashboard notification

### 8. Compliance

#### Standards Adherence
- **OWASP Top 10**: Regular assessment and mitigation
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Annual compliance review
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy controls
- **CCPA**: California consumer privacy compliance

#### Audit Requirements
- **Quarterly**: Security policy review
- **Semi-annually**: Penetration testing
- **Annually**: Compliance audit
- **Continuous**: Automated security scanning

### 9. Backup & Recovery

#### Backup Strategy
- **Database**: Daily full backup, continuous WAL archiving
- **Files**: Daily incremental, weekly full backup
- **Configuration**: Version controlled, immutable infrastructure
- **Encryption**: All backups encrypted at rest

#### Recovery Objectives
- **RTO (Recovery Time)**: 4 hours maximum
- **RPO (Recovery Point)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Testing**: Monthly recovery drills
- **Documentation**: Runbooks for all scenarios

### 10. Security Training

#### Developer Training
- **Secure Coding**: Annual training on OWASP guidelines
- **Incident Response**: Quarterly tabletop exercises
- **Tool Training**: Security scanner and monitoring tools
- **Updates**: Monthly security bulletins and updates

#### Security Awareness
- **Phishing**: Quarterly simulated phishing campaigns
- **Data Handling**: Proper handling of sensitive data
- **Access Management**: Password hygiene, MFA usage
- **Incident Reporting**: How and when to report incidents
