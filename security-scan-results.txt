## Known False Positives

### node-gyp test_gyp.py Command Injection (Line 205)
- **File:** node_modules/.pnpm/node-gyp@8.4.1/node_modules/node-gyp/gyp/test_gyp.py
- **Issue:** Command injection vulnerability in test file
- **Risk:** LOW - This is a test file not used in production
- **Action:** Ignore - Test files in transitive dependencies don't affect production
- **Justification:** The file is not referenced in package.json and is not executed during normal operation

## Other Vulnerabilities Found
- esbuild <=0.24.2 (moderate) - Development server vulnerability
- cookie <0.7.0 (low) - Cookie parsing vulnerability

## Recommendations
1. Update esbuild to >=0.25.0
2. Update cookie to >=0.7.0
3. Monitor for updates to sqlite3 that might resolve the node-gyp dependency
